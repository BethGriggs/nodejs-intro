# Prerequisites/Installation

- Install Node.js (preferably the latest Node 8):
 - Install a single version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/.
 - Install a Node Version manager (if you want to be able to switch between Node versions).
   - UNIX: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
   - Cross-platform: https://github.com/jasongin/nvs
- Editor of some kind (atom / VSCode / Vim).
- Confirm by typing `node --version`, `npm --version` in terminal.

Note: On Linux you should install to `/usr/local/bin` so that `node` and `npm` are in your `$PATH`.
